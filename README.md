# Tech-manual

## Goal

Change the color of the led lights with the internet and change the brightness of the light based on the time.

## First mistake

I was trying to make a part of my product that was too high a level for me in such a short time. So I started over with a simpler solution. The failed code I tried was to create an app where you can adjust all the settings of the Smart air conditioner without using adafruit. I managed to connect to the wifi, but I couldn't get the content from a website because I kept getting weird error messages like error -1, error -4, error -11. I didn't understand these problems well so I switched to a simpler problem.

## Supplies

1x Arduino Board(with wifi)

1x ledstrip

1x usb to arduino port

3x connecting wires (glued to LED strip)

## Connect arduino

To use the LED strip, you have to glue the connecting wires to the LED strip. It does not matter what color the connecting wires are glued. When the connecting wires are attached to the LED strip, you can connect it to the arduino. It doesn't matter how you click the connecting wires into the arduino, all sides work.

led strip = arduino

+5v = 3v3 

Din = D5 (you can make a choice here between D0 to D10 if you indicate that in your code)

GND = GND

Then connect the arduino to the computer and upload your code.

## Testing arduino
Go to the arduino software and click on file > examples > 01.Basics > Blink. Upload this code to the arduino when a patch flashes on the board you know that the arduino is working.

## Testing led

Open the arduino software and go to Sketch > Include library > Mannage libraries.

A new window should open from the library manager here you type in the search field Adafruit Neopixel. Find in the list and then click install > install all.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29665951/136687786-ef39ab39-7d8a-42c2-8b74-2e20cda58217.png)

When you have downloaded the library you can load a test script. Go to File > Examples > Adafruit NeoPixel > beach test. Important to know if you use the LED lighting, you should always adjust the LED_PIN in the code to the pin you placed in the arduino (D5). Then click upload and the LED strip should change color.

## Mistakes

A problem I had was that my LED strip did not work and you could not see this in the error message. The solution I found is that I borrowed the LED strip from someone in my class and then replaced it with a new one.

## Step 1 (Install Adafruit IO)
Open the arduino software and go to Sketch > Include library > Mannage libraries.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29665951/136405326-cf4ddd80-7a95-4a07-acf5-65730b938cf8.png)

A new window should open from the library manager here you type in the search field Adafruit IO Arduino. Find in the list and then click install > install all.
To install the time libary you have to do the same NTPClient.

## Mistake 
In the beginning I tried to add other people's code but it didn't work. What I didn't know was that when you use #include you also have to install a library before you can use other people's work I made this mistake a few times.

## Step 2 Sign in and create dashboard

Create an account at https://io.adafruit.com/. When you go to https://io.adafruit.com/timmit147/dashboards you can copy the Username and Active Key at My key.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29665951/136407565-6c9930a1-f342-4b2b-b435-9a73e958fa3f.png)

Then click on new dashboard and choose a name and description.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29665951/136407780-0e244058-1e17-49a4-b7c6-671dbd282989.png)

On the right side you can create a new block, choose color picker and fill in sheet according to the data.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29665951/136408107-436826b9-3d1c-49f6-b578-14f2371caf37.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29665951/136408199-3ed8a4a5-84a8-4e2a-ac84-a2541d9e42d6.png)

## Step 3 Connect code

Go to the arduino File > Examples > Adafruit IO Arduino > Adafruitio_14_neopixel

Change in the code:
PIXEL_PIN 5 to D5
io.feed to "io.adafruit.com feed name"

Change in the config:

IO-USERNAME to "io.adafruit.com username"

IO KEY to "io.adafruit.com key"

WIFI_SSID "Wifi name"

WIFI_PASS "wifi password"


Then upload your code to the arduino.

When it works you should see in your Serial Monitor that it is connected to the website.

Now you can change the color of the led on the website https://io.adafruit.com/ and click on save to upload the code to the arduino.

## Mistakes
At first I didn't understand that the Baud rate can be different per program and that I have to adjust it every time.

Another mistake I made was that I didn't specify the io.feed name in the code. If you want to adjust this, go to https://io.adafruit.com/timmit147/dashboards and select in the menu feeds and the feed you want to adjust. Then click on Feed info on the right side and there you will see the key of the feed. You can copy key name and put it in your code.

//loop every 1 second
   delay(1000);
}

// this function is called whenever a 'color' message
// is received from Adafruit IO. it was attached to
// the color feed in the setup() function above.
void handleMessage(AdafruitIO_Data *data) {

  // print RGB values and hex value from adafruit 
  Serial.println("Received HEX: ");
  Serial.println(data->value());

//change color data to neopixel
  long color = data->toNeoPixel();

//loop all pixels to change
  for(int i=0; i<PIXEL_COUNT; ++i) {
    pixels.setPixelColor(i, color);
  }

  pixels.show();

}

### Terminal 

When you look at the terminal you wil see that the arduino wil conect to the internet. The arduino is connected to the time and wil show every seconds in real time and the led strip wil change based on that info.
